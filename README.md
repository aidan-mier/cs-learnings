# Documenting my CS learning journey 

## Heres to new beginnings

As someone new to CS, I am dedicating this repository as a nuanced progress log, allowing me to showcase my evolving proficiency and growing understanding of the field. 
I would love to speak to anyone about anything tech related, especially tips and tricks regarding starting out learning how to code and use github, to make the process easier.
